#NeuroZoa


NeuroZoa is a basic set of Objective-C NeuralNetwork classes I worked on a few years ago.  It was hacked together in a few nights based off of some tutorials I read online, and could use a training set to train/execute XOR.  

I never took the implementation much further than that, but I decided to throw it up here.
